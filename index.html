            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am an ambitious and dedicated student at Trent University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a strong focus on applying academic knowledge to real-world problems in Cybersecurity and Data Analytics. Eager to deepen my understanding of IT security measures and data analysis techniques, I engage in various extracurricular activities and hands-on projects that enhance my skills and technical acumen. My goal is to utilize these experiences to secure information systems effectively and to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, thereby contributing to technological and business advancements. I actively seek internship opportunities with leading technology firms to gain invaluable industry experience and mentorship from pioneers in the field. Through this continuous learning and professional development, I aim to become a well-rounded specialist capable of addressing the challenges of the digital age.

                        The Encryption/Decryption Tool is an educational application designed to demonstrate the basic principles of cryptography through the implementation of the Caesar Cipher,
                        one of the simplest encryption techniques. Built using Python, this tool provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting text, making it an excellent resource for students and beginners interested in cybersecurity.
                        By allowing users to input text and a shift key, it showcases how data can be securely transformed and then restored.
                        This project not only enhances understanding of data protection but also serves as a practical introduction to the application of encryption in digital communications.
